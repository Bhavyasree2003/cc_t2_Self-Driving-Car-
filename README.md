![Self-Driving Car]

This repository contains code for simulating a self-driving car using Python.

## Description

The self-driving car simulation is implemented in the `self_driving_car.py` file. It includes a `Car` class that simulates the driving behavior of a car. The car's position is updated based on the provided speed values, and the resulting positions are plotted using Matplotlib.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository URL>

Install the required dependencies:
 pip install matplotlib
 
 Usage
 ******
Run the simulation:
python self_driving_car.py
This will execute the script and simulate the self-driving car. The car's position at different time intervals will be plotted using Matplotlib.

Customize the simulation:
**************************
Adjust the speeds list in the code to define the speed values for the car during the simulation.
Modify the plot settings in the code (e.g., axis labels, title, line style) to customize the visualization of the car's positions.
